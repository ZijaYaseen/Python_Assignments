# Guess the Number Game - Python Project

This is a simple guessing game I made as a student project. In this game, the computer tries to guess the number you are thinking of.

## What the Project Does

- The computer starts by guessing a number within a set range (for example, 1 to 1000).
- You provide feedback by telling the computer if its guess is too high (H), too low (L), or correct (C).
- Based on your feedback, the computer adjusts its range and makes another guess.
- The game continues until the computer guesses your number correctly and displays a congratulatory message.

## What I Learned

- How to use Pythonâ€™s `random` module to generate random numbers.
- How to write and use functions in Python.
- How to use loops and conditionals to control the flow of the program.
- How to get and use user input effectively.
