# Mad Libs Python Project

This project was made to practice Python basics. It asks you to enter an adjective, two verbs, and a famous person's name. Then, it creates a fun story using your words.

## What Was Learned

- **Getting User Input:** Learned how to ask for and use input from the user.
- **Using f-strings:** Practiced putting words into a sentence with f-strings.
- **Simple Program Structure:** Improved how to organize code and run a program.

## How It Works

1. The program asks for:
   - An adjective
   - Two verbs
   - A famous person's name
2. These words are inserted into a ready-made story.
3. The final story is printed on the screen.
